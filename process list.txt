Freshie Care guide:

Have you tried our Aroma Beads yet? These little beads are so cool and so much fun to play with and melt into fun shapes! You can put the loose beads into a sachet bag but the most popular way to use them is to melt them into shapes using metal cookie cutters. This little tutorial will walk you through the steps of melting Aroma Beads, so you can start creating your own from home or for your business!

First, let's gather all the necessary materials. For this tutorial, I did not show you how to add fragrance and color as we are just focusing on how to melt or bake them. For instructions on how to scent and color the beads check out our tutorial titled How to Make Aroma Beads which can be found in our Candle Making University.


Here's What You'll Need:
Fragrance Oil
Liquid Candle Dye
Aroma Beads
Metal Cookie Cutters
Parchment Paper (do not use wax paper!)
A Large Screw or Nail (optional)
Oven & Oven Mitts
Heavy Elastic Thread, Juite, Yarn, etc.

Step 1
This may take a little bit of trial and error as every oven is different. For my oven, I was able to preheat to 350°F but if your oven runs hot you may only want to bring it up to 325°F. The important thing is to test a small batch first to make sure your oven is going to be at the right temperature to melt the beads.


Step 2
The size of your baking sheet really depends on the number of shapes you are baking as well as the size of your oven. Keep in mind that cookie cutter size and the number of shapes you are baking can affect the time it takes to bake them. You will want to cover the bottom of your baking sheet with some parchment paper. This will help the beads easily release from the bottom of the pan. DO NOT USE WAX PAPER! If you use wax paper, the beads will stick to the paper and it will be nearly impossible to remove it without little bits stuck to the bottom of your aroma beads.


Step 3
You will want to try to evenly space your cookie cutters out on the baking sheet. Again, this will help the aroma beads to bake and melt more evenly. Typically, you want to try to keep the shapes all around the same size for each batch, which most of mine are here. The arrow shape was a little bit smaller, but I did not seem to have a problem getting it to melt evenly.


Step 4
If you would like to thread some sort of string through your shapes, we recommend using a medium to large size screw or nail to create a hole for the string. You can see that the two screws I am using here are about medium sized and around 1 inch long. (See next step for placement).


Step 5
This step can be a little bit tricky, especially if you have cookie cutters with a lot of detail. As you can see, the tiara and the butterfly here have several small nooks and crannies that required a little bit of help to spread the beads out evenly. I just used my fingers to make sure they were tucked inside the little crevices and even.


Step 6
Like the oven temperature, you will have to test out your baking time as well to get it just right. Our Aroma Bead manufacturer recommends melting them for about 6-10 minutes depending on size, the number of shapes, oven, temp, etc. For my beads, I put them in the oven for 7 minutes and they came out perfect!


Step 7
To see if your beads are ready to take out of the oven, GENTLY tap the top of the beads with a spoon, popsicle stick, skewer, or whatever you prefer to see if they are all stuck together. If they appear to be sticking to each other, go ahead and remove the beads from the oven and let them cool.

IMPORTANT: You do not want to let your beads melt down to a liquid! You are trying to melt the bottom of the beads together just a bit but still maintain a "loose" look on top. If you bake the beads for too long they can start to lose some of their scent throw.


Step 8
Once your beads have cooled, you can start removing them from the cookie cutters. The beads will stick to the sides of the cookie cutters just a bit, so it requires a little bit of wiggling and gentle pulling to get them to pop out. You can also remove any screws or nails used at this point simply by pushing the "sharp" end down on the counter or cookie sheet until it slides out.



Step 9
This next step is optional but works best if you want to hang your Aroma Beads in your car. Simply thread the string through the hole created by the nail or screw or, you can tie some string around a section of the shape to hang it. Make sure you create a loop that is large enough to fit around your rear-view mirror or leave the knot loose, so you can tie it up.


That's it!
You're finished! Once you have threaded your string through, you are ready to hang your aroma beads in your car, office, room, or anywhere you please!

Cup Care Guide:

Wondering how to make colorful and unique sublimation tumblers like the ones you see online?

If so, awesome! You're in the right place ✨

In this guide, we'll explain how to make sublimation tumblers (it's easy!) even if you're a total beginner to sublimation.

sublimation tumbler example

We'll take you through the printing process, list up the necessary materials, and share our favorite sublimation tumbler blanks. Finally, you'll find a troubleshooting guide to solve any problems you might run into.

🎥🌈✨ Watch our team sublimate our 40oz tumbler LIVE on Instagram here!

Don't wait another minute! Let's get started. ✨

How to Make Sublimation Tumblers
While it may seem complicated, making your own tumbler is surprisingly easy. Once you've got the equipment, it's just a matter of following a few simple steps and practicing until you get it right.

First up, here's what you'll need to make your first tumbler:

Step 1: Prepare Your Materials
sublimation tumbler materials

A design file - We'll talk about how to get one of these (or make your own) in the next section.
Sublimation tumbler blanks - A sublimation blank is an object that's designed for sublimation.
A sublimation printer - The machine you'll use to print your designs. You can get a specialized sublimation printer for tumblers or convert your own.
Sublimation ink - You'll load the printer with this specialized ink (also called sublimation dye) to print your transfers.
Sublimation paper - Load this into your printer to make a transfer sheet.
Heat-resistant tape - It's important to secure the transfer tightly onto your tumbler. You'll use heat-resistant tape for this.
Heat-resistant gloves - For removing your hot tumbler from the oven or heat press.
Well-ventilated room - This will keep the air clean as you sublimate your tumbler
Sublimation oven or heat press - These are used to sublimate the tumbler. We recommend a sublimation oven for beginners, but a tumbler press also works well. (Make sure your sublimation oven is strictly used for sublimation, not food.)
Save Time With a Sublimation Starter Kit

We've done all the hard work for you and put together all the supplies you need in our Epson F170 Sublimation Ultimate Starter Kit, including a set of tumblers to practice on.

Or if you already have a sublimation printer and just need the oven, tumblers, and other supplies, the MakerFlo Sublimation Oven Kit is for you!

Got all that? Now it's time to prepare your tumbler design. (The fun part!)

Step 2: Prepare the Design
You've probably seen some really unique, colorful designs already. (If not, take a peek inside our Facebook Group—you'll find some great ideas in there!)

Now you're wondering, how can I make tumblers like these?

You've got two choices here.

Find pre-made sublimation tumbler designs or templates on sites like Creative Fabrica. We've rounded up places to find more than 1000 free sublimation designs for commercial use.
Make your own design! You can make a sublimation tumbler design with any sublimation-friendly software you like, from Adobe Illustrator to Canva or anything in between.
To fit your tumbler, you'll want to make a design that matches the dimensions of your cup (plus a few millimeters around each edge to avoid white edges). It should be wide enough to meet at the seam with a little overlap.

Scroll down to the "Recommended Sublimation Tumblers" section to see our recommended sublimation tumblers, plus free wrap templates for each size.

Now, let's talk about making seamless sublimation tumblers. This takes some trial and error, but it's definitely possible, even if you're a design novice.

How to make seamless designs

Use a solid color. It's easiest to make seamless designs with a solid color because all you need to do is make sure the transfer paper overlaps a little at the edge. You could even make a gradient or striped design as long as both edges of your transfer use the same color.
Experiment with patterns. You can try to make seamless designs with repeating patterns, like an argyle or plaid-inspired design. This will take some experimenting, but once you find the right size for your design, you can adjust it until the pattern matches up perfectly at the seam. You can make patterns using any vector design software like Adobe Illustrator, Affinity Designer, Canva, and more.
Try the white seam option. You can make a design with two white (or same-colored) edges on either side. You can make it look like a ripped edge, create a gradient with your primary color, or use another effect to make it look natural. When your design meets at the seam, you won't have to worry about placing the design perfectly because both edges will match up.
Got your design just the way you like it? Great! Now it's time to print.

Step 3: Print Out the Design
This is the easy part! Make sure your sublimation ink and paper are loaded into your printer, use your printer's software to prepare for printing, and then print out the design.

Most sublimation printers should reverse the design for printing automatically. But if that doesn't work, you'll want to adjust your print settings so the design will print in reverse (like a mirror effect).

👉 Experiencing printing problems? Check out our sublimation printing troubleshooting guide to get the answers you seek!

You might notice that the colors in your transfer look faded. With sublimation, the ink activates when heat is applied, so the colors will become bright and vibrant during the transfer process.

(The image on the left is the sublimation transfer. The image on the right is a regular inkjet print for comparison.)

Speaking of which, let's talk about how to transfer your new sublimation transfer onto your tumbler.

Step 4: Transfer the Design to Your Tumbler
First, prepare your transfer. Cut it down to size (while preserving a slight edge on all sides), and tape it onto the tumbler with heat tape. (Make sure the tape is only on the transfer, not the tumbler itself.)

cutting down the transfer paper

If using a convection oven, you'll need to secure the design so it touches the tumbler on all sides without any gaps.

taping the sublimation tumbler

With a tumbler press, the press will clamp down on the design, removing most gaps. That said, you'll still want to tape down the design so it won't shift during transferring.

Option #1 - Convection oven method

Preheat your convection oven according to your tumbler instructions.

For Makerflo sublimation tumblers, we recommend baking at 375°F (190°C) for 5 to 6 minutes. If your tumbler is lying down flat, you’ll need to turn the tumbler halfway through baking. Luckily, the MakerFlo Sublimation Oven fits most of our tumbler blanks upright, so you don’t need to worry about this! (This is a general guideline—you'll figure out the perfect time and temp for your oven.)

putting sublimation tumbler into the oven

Once done, remove it from the heat and remove the sublimation paper to reveal your design! Some people recommend letting the paper cool or dipping it in water if you're having trouble removing the paper.

Option #2 - Heat press method

Press your tumbler in the heat press for the time and with the temperature your tumbler maker suggests.

For MakerFlo tumblers, we recommend pressing your tumblers at a temperature of 360 to 365°F Fahrenheit (182 to 185°C) for 40 seconds. If you need to rotate the tumbler, press it again for the same time at the same temperature.

Remove the tumbler from the press and then peel off the transfer paper. Voila! Your very own personalized tumbler is ready!

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is needed to make sublimation tumblers?
You'll need a sublimation printer, sublimation paper, sublimation ink, a sublimation-friendly tumbler, heat-resistant tape, heat-resistant gloves, and a convection oven or heat press to transfer the design. Check out the equipment list in the article above for more details.

Can you make any tumbler a sublimation tumbler?
Not all tumblers work for sublimation. They need a special coating that works with sublimation inks. MakerFlo sublimation tumblers are made for sublimation and come in a variety of shapes and sizes.

Do you need a special printer for sublimation tumblers?
Yes, you'll need a sublimation printer. You can buy a specialized sublimation printer like the Epson F170 (our favorite beginner printer). If you don't want to invest in a true sublimation printer, you can convert a regular Epson inkjet printer into a sublimation printer.

Learn more about the kind of printers you need in our guide to sublimation printers.

What kind of oven do you need for sublimation tumblers?
Any convection oven will do. Just make sure that any oven you use for sublimation is ONLY used for sublimation! The transfer process creates toxic fumes as a byproduct, and you don't want that getting into your food.

At what temperature should I bake my MakerFlo sublimation tumbler, and for how long?
When using a convection oven, all of Makerflo's cups should sublimate well at 375°F for 6 minutes. (This is a starting point. Ultimately it depends on your oven and how hot it runs.) If you're using a heat press, we recommend pressing it at 360-365°F for 40 seconds. If the cup needs to be rotated in the heat press, repeat the steps. We have a time and temp guide with more info.

Where can I get wholesale sublimation tumblers?
MakerFlo sells affordable wholesale tumblers in a variety of sizes. Check out our full line-up in the article above!

Can you make sublimation tumblers with a Cricut?
You can use Cricut Design Space to create designs, but you'll need to use a sublimation printer (or a converted printer) to print out your design. Or you can use Cricut Infusible Ink transfer sheets to create a design, but these are pre-printed. Instead of printing a design, you'll cut out the Infusible Ink transfer sheet in the design you want. Finally, you can use a Cricut Mug Press to sublimate a tumbler if you modify it to fit the tumbler.

Photo Slate: 

How To Create Custom Photo Slates
If you want to take your photo presentation to the next level, this is a video you don’t want to miss. I’ll be showing you how these blank photo slates, made from natural stone, can be customized with your photographs.
If you feel that your photos could be complemented by a more earthy theme than the usual wood frame, these matte sublimation photo slates offer a unique stone style that look absolutely amazing. These are made completely from natural slate, having a white matte surface with beveled edges. You’ll be able to bring vibrant, full color images onto these photo slates through sublimation. They make for beautiful gifts and are a favorite among professional photographers.


Due to the thick nature of these photo slates however, it’s best to have some heat felt on-hand - such as Geo Knight’s Nomex heat felt. This will make the application process much easier, as heat felt is able to cushion the slate and will help provide consistent heat across the entire item. While we generally recommend using a swing away heat press for photo tiles and slates, we’ll be demonstrating with a clamshell Signature Pro heat press. This is just to show that customizing these slates can still work regardless of your machine’s form factor. But to begin, prepare the image or graphic you’d like to apply onto the slate within the dimensions of the slate.


For the Medium Square and Medium Rectangle photo slates, you can download our templates in the description below to use them with photo editing or graphic design software. By loading one of the templates onto Adobe Illustrator for instance, you can simply import your image, set it under the Bleed layer, select both the Bleed and image layers, right click and Make Clipping Mask. Set the opacity on the imprint and safety areas to 50%, and you’ll have a better idea on how to organize your image and any additional layers within the photo slate.


Once your image is ready, hide the imprint and safety layers if using the template, then you may print it through your sublimation printer. For Sawgrass printers, set it to Sawgrass Print Manager and use these settings: Substrate set to Slate, Paper set to your paper’s profile, leave Mirror checked, and in the Color tab, set the Color Mode to either Photographic or Vivid depending on your image’s level of detail. With these settings ready, go ahead and click the Print button.


Now that our image has been printed, we’re ready to customize our photo slates. Before turning on your machine, it’s best to determine its medium pressure setting as you press the slate with heat resistant felt. Add heat resistant felt on the lower platen, then a blank slate on top, and you can test press and adjust pressure accordingly. If you have a heat press with a removable silicone pad, you may need to take it out if you’re unable to press down. But once you’ve found the right pressure, take the blank slate out then turn on your heat press, setting it to 480 seconds, or 8 minutes, at 400 degrees Fahrenheit.


Once your machine reaches temperature, cover the heat felt with a sheet of parchment paper, then add your printed transfer on top. Now you can bring your photo slate over and place it above the printed image, with the white side facing down towards it. To keep it in place, use strips of heat tape to attach it onto the transfer. Finally, cover everything with another parchment paper sheet and press. After 8 minutes, open your machine and allow the slate’s transfer to cool down for a moment. After it’s cooled, flip the transfer over then quickly peel the transfer from the center and your custom photo slate is now complete!

Glass Cutting board: 

Supplies

For this project, you only need a couple of supplies. Some you may already have stashed away if you have anything like the ridiculous crafting stash I do (sometimes I wonder if “crafting” borders on “hoarding”…). You’ll need:

Glass cutting boards – I use a 12×15″ glass cutting board.
Glass etching cream – the only brand I’ve used is Armor Etch, and it always works like a charm.
Vinyl – I use Oracal 651. Generally I stick with colors from a multi-color pack that I don’t think I’ll use on other projects, but you can buy rolls that are inexpensive.
Transfer tape – AT65 medium tack transfer tape works like magic for me, but any transfer paper or tape will work.
Popsicle sticks (or another tool to spread the cream around)
Silhouette Cameo 3 (or other cutting machine)
Design you want to etch onto the cutting board – See my shop for a variety of fun designs including the split monograms seen in this tutorial.
Disclosure: Some of these links are affiliate links, meaning, at no additional cost to you, I will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.

The Basics

Glass etching cream is comprised of an acid that eats away at the surface of the glass. It leaves behind a frosted look compared to the relative smoothness of the rest of the glass. Due to the process simply removing a small amount of material, the piece of kitchenware (cutting board, pint glass, etc.) retains all of its original characteristics such as microwave and dishwasher safeness.

For this project to work the best, the etching cream is applied to the back of the cutting board, which is smooth.

Instructions

To create an etched glass cutting board of your very own, do the following:

Choose a design for your cutting board, and import it into your cutting machine’s software. Ensure the design is mirrored as shown in the photo below. This will allow the design to be placed on the bottom of the cutting board with the text visible from the top.

2. Size and cut your vinyl to fit your design.


Cut, cut, cut
3. Place on your cutting mat.


Vinyl lightly adhered to cutting mat
Pro Tip: Always perform a test cut of your material to ensure your design will cut as desired.


Silhouette Cameo 3 test cut
4. Cut your design.


5. Once your cut is complete, weed the design. You’ll want to remove what you want to etch, so this will generally be the actual design. It will leave behind the “stencil” of the design for you to etch.

6. Apply your transfer tape or paper to your vinyl. Ensure all of the pieces of your design are stuck to the transfer tape.


7. Carefully remove the backing from the vinyl.


Caution! Please note that the vinyl should be adhered to the back of the cutting board (the smooth side for the cutting boards I used) if you mirrored your design.

8. Align your design as desired on your glass cutting board, and apply the vinyl.

Pro Tip: Measure the center of the cutting board, and place a dot using highlighter or another removable ink where the center is on the front of the cutting board. Use this to help guide where you place your design.


9. Use a credit card or other tool to ensure the vinyl is securely adhered to the glass cutting board and there are no bubbles near the edges where the etching cream will be applied.

10. Remove the transfer tape leaving the vinyl adhered to the cutting board.


Pro Tip: Use masking tape or even wax paper on the edges of the cutting board not covered in vinyl to cover the glass. This will ensure that the etching cream doesn’t come in contact with any glass when you’re rinsing the etching cream off. It will also protect the glass in case any etching cream is dripped.

11. Apply etching cream to your design using a popsicle stick to spread the cream around and ensure everything is adequately coated.


12. Wait for the magic to happen!

Pro Tip: To ensure a good etch, I allow the cream to remain on the design for 10 minutes, swirl the cream around with the popsicle to ensure there’s no unevenly coated areas or bubbles, allow another 10 minutes to elapse, swirl the cream again & finally allow another 10 minutes of etching. This totals 30 minutes of etching time plus two swirls.

13. Remove as much excess etching cream back into the bottle with the popsicle stick as you can. You’ll be able to use it again for your next project!

14. Rinse any remaining etching cream off your design with water. Be sure the cream does not come in contact with any of the glass during rinsing.

15. Remove vinyl.

16. Rinse your cutting board thoroughly with soap.

17. Dry thoroughly.

Note: Your design will not show up well until the design is 100% dry & may look as if it isn’t etched well if water remains.

18. Admire your handiwork!


These glass cutting boards can be easily personalized, are easy to make and look professionally made. These will dazzle anyone who you gift one to or will make a statement piece for your own kitchen. If you jump into the glass etching world and try your hand at a cutting board, I would love to see your work! Be sure to tag @bysabrinamarie on Instagram with your project!

Along with the tutorial, I’ll also share my best tips for ensuring that your DIY wind spinner turns out beautifully the first time. For example, when handling the spinners, only touch the edges to avoid getting skin oils on the surfaces, and keep the metal as flat as possible. Oils or bumps can mess up the sublimation later!



 

You can use most styles of heat press, but I’ll use a Cricut EasyPress. My Sublimation Cookbook has the temperatures and times for other options, too. Be sure to wear heat gloves — the aluminum can stay hot a lot longer than you think!



 

When you’re finished, you’ll have a beautiful customized wind spinner for your yard that is sure to impress all of you neighbors. Plus, I’ll show you how to space out the rings around the central axis so it will spin in the slightest breeze. These spinners look great outdoors on a breezy day, and since they’re sublimated, they’ll hold up to a season or two of sun, especially with some extra protection.



 

If the spinner will get a lot of sun, it’s a great idea take it outside with some UV Resistant Clear Coat Spray and a cardboard box. Good ventilation is super important when working with the clear coat. Put the spinner in the open box to protect it from debris, and to protect the area from the spray. Next, spray a light coat over the spinner and let it dry for 10 minutes. Once it’s totally dry, flip the spinner over and coat the other side, too. You can protect all of the spinners this way. Once it’s dry, string some fishing line through the small hole at the top, hang your new wind spinner up, and enjoy!



 

No place outdoors to hang it? You can totally use your DIY wind spinner indoors! I’ve listed a small motor you can hang the wind spinner on. Just attach the motor’s clip to the top hole instead of the swivel clip and set it for 10 rotations per minute.



A colorful wind spinner is a great way to add a personal touch to your outdoor space. These are a great beginner’s project if you’re just getting started with sublimation, and are one of those easy crafts you can do with kids of all ages.

0:35
to begin I'm going to use this guide
0:36
wire to get that 20 mm rhinestone onto
0:39
our cord we folded the cord in half and
0:41
now we're pulling it through where you
0:43
see the loop you're going to tie a
0:45
standard knot and pull it to the very
0:47
end and that's going to secure that 20
0:49
mm bead right onto your cord next I'm
0:52
going to sear the edges of the cord just
0:54
so that it's easier for me to get it
0:55
onto that 70 mm beating
0:58
needle now I'm going to start threading
1:00
using the needle all of the beads in the
1:03
desired design onto the
1:10
cord I'm going to begin by putting that
1:12
65 mm silicone ring right above the 20
1:16
mm rhinestone then I'll put my silicone
1:19
beads that I want to be in the middle of
1:22
that ring so I'm going to go ahead and
1:24
string all three of those next using
1:27
that needle go ahead and pull the cord
1:29
through through the other hole in that
1:31
65 mm ring now your design is in the
1:34
middle totally adorable you'll continue
1:38
this process and put the rest of the
1:39
beads onto your cord once the rest are
1:42
on you'll tie a basic knot at the top of
1:51
that with the connecting part facing
